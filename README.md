## La Liga App

## How to run it

Run: 

`npm install`
`npm run start`

Go to `http://localhost:3000`

## Considerations

Aside from the basic requirements, I've added:

* Pagination
* Light/Dark Theme - persists through Local Storage
* I tried to follow the La Liga styling guide, and used the Core Sans font
* I used a modal for CRUD operations
